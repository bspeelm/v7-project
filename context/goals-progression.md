# Goals & Progression Plan

## Primary Goals
1. **Climb V7 consistently** (currently V5-V6)
2. **Reach 165 lbs bodyweight** (from 173-175 lbs)
3. **Master overhang climbing** (current weakness)

## Timeline & Milestones

### Immediate (1-2 weeks)
- Establish proper recovery patterns
- Increase daily protein to 100g minimum
- Let inflammation settle (return to 170-172 lbs)
- Practice tension drills on V2-V4 overhangs

### Short-term (1-3 months)
- Consistent 120-130g protein daily
- Gradual calorie increase to 2200-2400
- V6 on overhangs (from current V5)
- Weight: 170 lbs with better body composition
- Creatine saturation complete

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- V7 on favorable style (slab/vertical)
- V6+ on overhangs
- Weight: 167-168 lbs
- Fingerboard: 15mm for 10 seconds
- Established 2-rest-day routine

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- V7 across all angles
- Weight stabilized at 165 lbs
- V8 project level
- Consistent onsighting 5.10+

## Key Performance Metrics to Track

### Weekly
- Weight (same time, same conditions)
- Protein intake average
- Training hours
- Rest day compliance
- Energy levels (1-10)

### Monthly
- Max boulder grade sent
- Overhang vs slab performance gap
- Fingerboard progression
- Body composition changes
- Recovery time needed

## Technical Focus Areas

### Overhang Technique Development
1. **Initiation**: Engage core before moving
2. **Tension maintenance**: Stay hollow through moves
3. **Foot precision**: Trust feet on steep angles
4. **Hip positioning**: Stay close to wall
5. **Breathing**: Don't hold breath on hard moves

### Sloper Strategy (Overhang Weakness)
- Generate from legs, not arms
- Keep hips in, shoulders out
- Use whole hand/palm
- Commit to body position
- Don't overgrip

## Success Indicators

### You're On Track When:
- Morning weight stable day-to-day
- Energy consistent through sessions
- Grades improving monthly
- Recovery feels adequate
- Motivation remains high

### Warning Signs:
- Weight swings >3 lbs
- Can't climb 2 grades below max
- Chronic fatigue/soreness
- Dreading training sessions
- Sleep quality declining

## Mindset Reminders

1. **You're 42, not 24** - Recovery is part of performance
2. **Peak years ahead** - Climbing peaks around your age
3. **Process over outcome** - Daily habits create long-term results
4. **Fuel the machine** - Can't out-train poor nutrition
5. **Listen to your body** - It's giving you valuable data

## Monthly Check-ins

Use journal to assess:
- Are grades progressing?
- Is weight trending correctly?
- Do you feel strong or depleted?
- Are you enjoying the process?
- What needs adjustment?
