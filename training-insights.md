# Training Insights & Key Learnings

## Major Discoveries

### 1. Overhang Weakness is Technical, Not Physical
- **Issue**: Indoor V5-V6 on slabs but only V4 on overhangs
- **Root Cause**: Not finger strength (can hang 15mm) but tension maintenance
- **Solution**: Focus on motor pattern adaptation, not more fingerboarding
- **Key Insight**: "Slow, precise, intentional" movement on steep terrain

### 2. Recovery Needs Have Changed at 42
- **Previous**: 18-hour recovery between sessions
- **Current Reality**: Needs 24-36 hours between hard efforts
- **Evidence**: 5-pound weight spike (170→175) from inflammation after overtraining
- **Adaptation**: Quality over quantity, smarter programming

### 3. Severe Under-fueling
- **Current**: ~1800 calories, 40-50g protein daily
- **Needed**: 2200-2400 calories, 120-130g protein
- **Impact**: Performance crashes (couldn't do V1 at 50° when fatigued)
- **Paradox**: Under-eating prevents weight loss due to metabolic adaptation

## Training Principles

### Optimal Weekly Structure
**Current (Unsustainable)**:
- Monday: Light workout
- Tuesday: Indoor Boulder 4-7pm
- Wednesday: Fingerboard/pullups/pushups
- Thursday: Indoor Boulder
- Friday: Complete rest
- Saturday: Kilter board 2 hours
- Sunday: Outdoors 4-8 hours

**Recommended Adjustment**:
- Add second rest day
- Reduce consecutive training days
- Prioritize quality over volume

### Fingerboard Protocol (Effective)
- 7 x 10sec Jug (warm-up)
- 7 x 7secs 30mm
- 2 x 7secs 20mm  
- 3 x 5secs 15mm
- Rest: 2-3 minutes between hangs
- Focus: Maintenance, not progression

### Signs of Overtraining
1. Weight spikes 3-5 pounds (inflammation)
2. Can't climb 2-3 grades below normal
3. Feeling "antsy" on rest days
4. Poor sleep despite fatigue
5. Chronic soreness

## Performance Metrics

### Current Benchmarks
- **2-mile run**: 2/10 perceived effort
- **Fingerboard**: 15mm for 5 seconds
- **Pull-ups**: 5x6 reps
- **Training capacity**: 15+ hours/week

### Target Improvements
- **Weight**: 175 → 165 lbs
- **Bouldering performance**: V4 → V7
- **Protein intake**: 50g → 130g daily
- **Caloric intake**: 1800 → 2200-2400

## Key Realizations

1. **"Rest IS training"** - Recovery allows adaptation
2. **Peak performance at 42** - Not running out of time, entering prime years
3. **Efficiency > Volume** - Three quality sessions beat five mediocre ones
4. **Inflammation management** - Weight fluctuations are water, not fat
5. **Protein priority** - Can't out-train inadequate nutrition
