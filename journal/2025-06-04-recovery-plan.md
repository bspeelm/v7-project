# June 4, 2025 - Recovery Day Plan

## Session Details
- **Type**: Full recovery day
- **Status**: Planned (after today's crash)
- **Focus**: Inflammation reduction, protein optimization

## Physical State Going In
- Weight: 175 lbs (up from 170 - inflammation)
- Sore from Monday's excessive training
- Need true recovery after 3 consecutive training days

## Recovery Protocol
### Movement
- NO running
- NO strength work
- Light mobility only during 8-hour work day
- Maximum: 20-minute gentle walk if antsy

### Nutrition Goals
- **Target**: 100g+ protein (vs usual 40-50g)
- **Calories**: 2000-2200+ (vs usual 1800)
- **Focus**: Greek yogurt discovery for protein efficiency

### Meal Plan
- **Breakfast**: Oatmeal + Orgain (26g protein) or 2 Greek yogurts (32g)
- **Mid-morning**: Greek yogurt (16g)
- **Lunch**: Protein bar + fruit (20g)
- **Afternoon**: Nuts/edamame (8g)
- **Dinner**: Tofu + quinoa + veggies (20g)
- **Evening**: Protein shake if needed

### Supplements
- Morning: B-complex, D3/K2, Omega-3
- Pre/post workout: Skip (no workout)
- Evening: Magnesium L-Threonate (3 capsules - proper dose confirmed)

## Expected Outcomes
- Weight drop to 172-173 as inflammation settles
- Energy restoration
- Ready for Thursday's climbing session

## Week Plan
- **Thursday**: Return to climbing with quality focus
- **Friday**: Normal rest day
- **Saturday**: Kilter board if feeling good
- **Sunday**: Outdoor climbing

## Key Insight
Yesterday's crash taught me that "light workout" days aren't light at my volume. Monday's bike ride + strength work + sport climbing from Sunday = too much without recovery.

## Mental State
Accepting the new reality at 42: need smarter recovery, not just more training. This IS part of the process.
