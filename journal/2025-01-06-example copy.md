# Climbing Session Journal Entry

**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Location**: The Climbing Gym
**Session Type**: Training
**Duration**: 2.5 hours

## Grades
- **Warmed up on**: V2, V3 (5 climbs)
- **Working grades**: V5-V6
- **Sent**: V5 (overhang), V5 (slab), V4 (dynamic)
- **Projects**: V6 (crimpy face) - got to last move 3x
- **Max attempt**: V6

## Physical State
- **Energy level**: 7/10
- **Pre-session soreness**: Light (shoulders from yesterday)
- **Post-session fatigue**: 8/10
- **Injuries/tweaks**: Slight tweak in left ring finger A2 pulley

## Technical Focus
- **What worked well**: Hip positioning on overhang, trusting feet on slab
- **Struggled with**: Crimps on the V6, maintaining tension through the crux
- **Technique practiced**: Drop knee practice, heel hooks

## Mental Game
- **Confidence level**: 6/10
- **Fear/commitment issues**: Hesitated on the V6 crux move (fear of falling)
- **Flow state moments**: Felt great flow on the V5 overhang

## Key Observations
- Need to work on crimp strength - fingers gave out before power
- Drop knees feeling more natural, especially on slight overhangs
- Mental game needs work on committing to dynamic moves when pumped

## Next Session Goals
- Warm up fingers more thoroughly
- Focus session on crimp strength and lock-off practice
- Try the V6 project fresh at start of session
