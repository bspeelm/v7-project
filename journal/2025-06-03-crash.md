# June 3, 2025 - The Overtraining Crash

## Session Details
- **Type**: Indoor bouldering (attempted)
- **Location**: Gym
- **Duration**: Unknown (cut short)
- **Time**: Evening session

## What Happened
Came in after what I thought was a "rest day" yesterday, but it really wasn't:

**Yesterday's "Light Workout"**:
- 7-mile bike ride with steep hill
- 5x6 pull-ups (30 total)
- 3x10 wrist curls
- 10x3 military presses (15 lbs)
- 20x3 push-ups
- 10x2 hanging leg raises
- 3x30sec hollow body hold
- 10min fingerboard training down to 3x5secs on 15mm

## Performance
- **Couldn't climb V1 at 50°** on the Kilter Board (normally warm up on harder)
- **Max grade: V3** on 20-30° walls
- Completely depleted, no power or tension

## Physical State
- Weight: **175 lbs** (up from 170 after sport climbing 2 days ago)
- 5-pound gain = inflammation/water retention
- Felt sore going into session
- No energy despite proper fueling

## Key Realizations
1. I don't recover as quickly as I used to (maybe need 24-36 hours now vs 18)
2. "Light workout" days are still training load at my volume
3. Body forced me to rest through poor performance
4. Need to respect recovery more at 42

## Nutrition
- Breakfast: 2/3 cup oatmeal with blueberries
- Lunch: Protein bar (20g)
- Pre-climb: 2 slices cauliflower pizza, supplements (creatine, collagen)
- Post-climb: 2.5 gr creatine 
- Dinner: Noodles and veggies with flatbread
- Snack: serving of yogurt (19g protien)
- Total protein: Only ~70g (way under 130g target)

## Lessons Learned
- When weight spikes 3-5 lbs overnight, it's inflammation saying "rest"
- Can't power through fatigue anymore
- Under-fueling (1800 cal) making everything worse
- Quality > quantity for training at this age

## Plan Forward
- Take a FULL rest day tomorrow (no running)
- Get protein up to 100g minimum
- Let inflammation settle
- Reassess training schedule to add more recovery

## Mental State
Frustrated but accepting. This is my body teaching me limits. Better to learn through one bad session than through injury.
