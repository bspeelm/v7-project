# V7 Climbing Journal - AI Context

This is an AI-assisted journal for tracking progress toward climbing V7. The journal entries provide context for AI to give personalized climbing advice.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Climb V7
- **Format**: Markdown journal entries with structured data
- **Purpose**: Track progress, identify patterns, get AI coaching

## Journal Entry Structure
Each entry should include:
- Date
- Session type (training/outdoor/gym)
- Grades attempted and completed
- Physical condition (energy, soreness, injuries)
- Technical focus areas
- Mental state
- Notes on specific climbs or breakthroughs

## AI Coaching Focus Areas
When analyzing journal entries, AI should consider:
- Progression patterns
- Recovery needs
- Technique improvements
- Mental game development
- Training load balance
- Injury prevention
- Breakthrough moments

## Key Context Files

### Athlete Information
- `athlete-profile.md` - Current stats, performance levels, background
- `goals-progression.md` - Timeline and milestones toward V7
- `quick-reference.md` - Daily targets, supplement timing, recovery indicators

### Training Context
- `training-insights.md` - Major discoveries about training needs
- `training-sessions.md` - Reference for typical weekly structure
- `nutrition-plan.md` - Vegetarian protein strategies and meal planning

### Journal Management
- `journal/` - All climbing session entries
- `journal-template.md` - Template for creating new entries
- Use date format: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

## Important Athlete Context
- 42-year-old vegetarian climber
- 3 years climbing experience
- Currently climbing indoor V5-V6 (slab), V4 (overhang)
- Weight: 173-175 lbs (goal: 165 lbs)
- Weakness: Overhang climbing (tension maintenance, not finger strength)
- Training 15+ hours/week
- Under-eating (1800 cal, 50g protein vs 2200-2400 cal, 130g protein needed)

## Common Commands
- Create new journal entry: Copy `journal-template.md` to `journal/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- Review progress: Analyze journal entries chronologically
- Update context files when major insights emerge from journal patterns
